# Bumpa.io
Game where you are a hexagonal spaceship, but the universe is too small to accept others, you have to push (bump) them out.
Both players will have 5 seconds of cooldown after collision and a knockback.
There is only uniform rectilinear trajectories and no friction (like in space).

  - Collision between 2 players
